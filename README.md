# Kaggle-Starter
This is one of the project on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification
The main aim of this notebook is help me review quickly some basic techniques in sklearn
I found that GradientBoosting is really amazing even without any feature engineering and feature selection
Some basic feature engineering techniques are used including Standardlization, though which seems useless.



*I have not try too much on tuning hyperparameters and models
*This is a very simple demo to have a quick review of how to use sklearn
*No Golden feature founded
