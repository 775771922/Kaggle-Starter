Some basic code including some basic data preprocessing steps, however, it seems 
dummy+standardlization is better than standardlization. The order of the data preprocessing is 
impportant to some extent.

Another thing is that GBoosting works not very well, even worse than logistic regression without tuning parameters on cross-validation.
